# MineClient Bridge: integrated development snapshot

> Based on upstream 1.1.5, with experimental terrain, guarded combat and guarded forward samples (`1.1.5-terrain-guard-movement.1`). The current full mod build and 35 JUnit cases pass, and small read-only live terrain checks pass; guarded combat/movement and navigation acceptance remain incomplete. Read [the repository status](../README.md#验证状态) and [current movement build verification](docs/movement-verification.md). Historical upstream checks below do not verify these extensions.


MineClient Bridge is a client-side NeoForge 1.21.1 mod that exposes an authenticated HTTP interface on the local loopback address. External tools can inspect the active Minecraft client, capture its current framebuffer, and operate configured keys and GUI controls. Isolated background sessions use process-local virtual input rather than the operating system cursor and clipboard.

The repository also includes an optional MCP server and a reusable Codex skill for isolated client acceptance workflows. MineClient Bridge is independent of any gameplay mod.

## Supported Environment

- Minecraft 1.21.1
- NeoForge 21.1.197 or newer within the 21.1 line
- Java 21
- Client installation only; no server installation is required

The mod itself has no gameplay-mod dependency. The optional prepared-root launcher in the bundled MCP currently targets Windows because it launches clients on native background desktops. Direct HTTP clients can use the mod without the MCP.

## Capabilities

- Read bridge and client session status.
- Capture the presented framebuffer as PNG without writing a screenshot first.
- Inspect configured key mappings and held state.
- Inspect bounded player, world, inventory, effect, crosshair, weather, nearby-entity, GUI-widget, and container-slot state.
- Press, release, or tap a named Minecraft `KeyMapping`, or send an internal keyboard event for keys such as Enter, Escape, and F1.
- Change player view, send normal in-world mouse buttons and scroll through Minecraft's native mouse callback, operate GUI pointer controls, and submit bounded text through the active screen.
- Submit a Minecraft command directly without opening the chat screen.
- Release all held mappings and request a graceful client shutdown.

MineClient Bridge does not expose arbitrary shell commands, scripts, filesystem operations, or direct world-edit endpoints. Its input endpoints can still trigger normal gameplay and GUI actions, just as a player can.

## Security And Privacy

- The HTTP server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default and rejects non-loopback callers again on every request.
- Every `/control/*` request requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- A 256-bit token is generated with `SecureRandom`, stored in `config/mineclient-bridge.token`, restricted to the current owner where the platform supports it, and never logged.
- `config/mineclient-bridge.json` contains only `enabled`, `host`, and `port`.
- Request bodies, JSON responses, framebuffer PNGs, queries, GUI entries, and text input all have fixed upper bounds.
- Text and command input reject control characters and enforce fixed length limits.
- Authorized command input uses Minecraft's normal client command path; the connected server still decides command permissions.
- Held mappings are released when the bridge or client stops.
- The mod contains no telemetry and sends no data to an external service.

Any local program that receives the token can operate the exposed client actions. Do not publish or share the token. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the threat model and reporting instructions.

## Installation

1. Install NeoForge for Minecraft 1.21.1.
2. Only after separately approving experimental installation, place `mineclient-bridge-neoforge-1.21.1-1.1.5-terrain-guard-movement.1.jar` in a disposable test client's `mods` directory. Preserve the known-working client; never install two bridge versions together. Follow the guarded-action acceptance gates before enabling that route.
3. Start the client. The mod creates its config and token files on first launch.
4. Connect an authorized loopback client to `http://127.0.0.1:38121` using the generated token.

The bridge is enabled by default. Set `"enabled": false` in `config/mineclient-bridge.json` to turn it off. The host is always constrained to loopback. Runtime overrides are available through `mineclientBridge.*` system properties or `MINECLIENT_BRIDGE_*` environment variables for `enabled`, `host`, `port`, and `token`.

## Background Input Isolation

Version 1.1.3 virtualizes mouse capture/release, keyboard polling and clipboard
access in isolated sessions. Physical keyboard and mouse callbacks are ignored
there; authenticated Bridge input still runs through Minecraft's handlers.
Normal foreground Minecraft sessions retain their native input behavior.

Version 1.1.5 also lets an isolated session grab the mouse without operating system
focus. Minecraft refuses to continue an attack or to turn the player while the mouse is
ungrabbed, and `MouseHandler.grabMouse()` is gated on window focus that such a client
never receives. The bypass is scoped to that one method, so window focus keeps its normal
meaning everywhere else, and the native cursor is still never captured.

Enable isolation with `-DmineclientBridge.isolatedInput=true` or
`MINECLIENT_BRIDGE_ISOLATED_INPUT=true`. A supplied non-Default
`mineclientBridge.desktopName` or `MINECLIENT_BRIDGE_DESKTOP_NAME` also enables
it by default. The bundled background launcher explicitly enables it and checks
the installed isolation classes before launch and the live capability before
input. `/control/status` reports `input_isolation` and its suppression counters.

An independent Windows Desktop alone does not isolate the shared Windows cursor.
These hooks cover Minecraft's input APIs; they are not an operating-system
sandbox for arbitrary third-party native code. Gameplay mods that directly warp
the OS pointer must use a process-local path in their background integration.

## HTTP Endpoints

`GET /control/status`, `GET /control/capabilities`, `GET /control/frame`, `GET /control/keymaps`, `GET /control/state`, `GET /control/terrain`, `GET /control/screen`, `POST /control/key`, `POST /control/raw-key`, `POST /control/look`, `POST /control/mouse`, `POST /control/text`, `POST /control/command`, `POST /control/release-all`, and `POST /control/close`.

All Minecraft state reads and input changes are dispatched to the client main thread. A named mapping is driven through the handler its bound key would use, so `InputEvent.Key` and `InputEvent.MouseButton` are published and gameplay mods that read their controls from those events respond; like a real device, every mapping sharing that key reacts. Send `"exact": true` to activate only the requested `KeyMapping` instead, by borrowing an unused keyboard key for the length of one event; an unbound mapping always uses that route. A borrowed key cannot be held, and a mouse-bound mapping is refused while a screen is open, because the screen route would click whatever the pointer sits on rather than activate the mapping. World mouse buttons use Minecraft's native `MouseHandler` callback so NeoForge and gameplay-mod input events receive the same press/release sequence as a real client mouse; world scroll passes through NeoForge's mouse-scroll event before normal hotbar behavior. `POST /control/command` accepts up to 256 command characters with or without a leading slash. `POST /control/text` keeps normal chat-screen behavior, so submitted slash-prefixed text is handled as a command by Minecraft. Raw keys are delivered through Minecraft's own `KeyboardHandler`; the bridge never injects operating-system input. Raw-key and world-mouse `down` and `up` actions are idempotent. A `click` on a held input completes that press; otherwise it sends a new press/release pair, so every click ends released and repeated clicks remain independent. Release-all, close, and bridge shutdown emit native releases for every tracked raw key and world mouse button, including when a screen opened while a world button was held.

Every key, raw-key and world-mouse response carries `mod_input_event`, listing each event that dispatch published and whether a mod cancelled it, and `/control/status` reports `mouse` and `mod_input_events`. Together they separate a gameplay mod deliberately taking over a button from input that never arrived. `event_fired: false` is not by itself proof of the latter: Minecraft returns before publishing a key event when a screen consumes the key, exactly as it does for a physical keyboard. The screen-scope `mouse`, `look`, `text`, `command` and `release-all` routes do not drive a device handler and carry no `mod_input_event`.

## MCP And Codex Integration

The optional MCP server lives in [`mcp/`](mcp/). It exposes seven `minecraft_client_*` tools for launch/register, status, framebuffer capture, structured queries, bounded input, and exact-session shutdown. See [mcp/README.md](mcp/README.md) for installation and its Windows prepared-root contract.

The reusable skill at [`integrations/codex/minecraft-client-acceptance`](integrations/codex/minecraft-client-acceptance) describes evidence-based client testing and disjoint multi-agent background-client batches.

## Historical Upstream Live Client Verification


The upstream project documented a real 960x540 framebuffer from its NeoForge 1.21.1 smoke session. The gameplay model belongs to a separate compatibility-test mod; MineClient Bridge adds no in-game overlay. In the same session the MCP verified exact process/desktop/root identity, queried client state and 46 key mappings, captured PNG pixels, exercised view and `key.sneak` press/release, cleared held input, and confirmed exact PID and background Desktop cleanup. The machine-readable summary is in [`docs/evidence/1.0.0-client-smoke.json`](https://github.com/Campione01/MineClient-Bridge/blob/60e78940f7e7fa06116cf4fbc58df346ad617531/docs/evidence/1.0.0-client-smoke.json).

## Experimental terrain extension

See [the bounded terrain API](docs/terrain-api.md) for paging, limits, unknown-cell semantics, validation, and current verification limits. This integrated development source uses version `1.1.5-terrain-guard-movement.1`; it is not a live-tested release.

The terrain extension passed a complete Gradle compile/test/build against NeoForge 21.1.255 using the official memory-efficient binary dependency pipeline. See [verification details](docs/terrain-verification.md). The earlier terrain-only extension passed limited live reads of a 27-cell cube, equivalent seven-page scan and 17-cell vertical boundary. Sanitized offline schema/planner regressions also pass. Maximum scans, navigation and combat remain unvalidated; this does not live-accept the current movement build. See [the limited live record](docs/terrain-live-validation.md) and [captured-data limits](../navigation-controller/docs/PROTOCOL.md#captured-schema-regression).

## Experimental guarded local actions

The additive, default-disabled [guarded action endpoint](docs/guarded-actions.md)
is an experimental interface for bounded look and ordinary attack attempts in an
unpublished local Survival world. Planning stays external. Its dependency-free
guard/cancellation checks do not establish a full NeoForge build or live-combat
acceptance, and existing upstream input routes are unchanged.

The preceding terrain + guard build passed all 14 Gradle/JUnit cases. It is still disabled for guarded input by default and has no live acceptance. See [integrated verification](docs/integrated-verification.md).

## Experimental guarded forward sample

The current source adds a separate **default-disabled, unaccepted**
[guarded forward sample](docs/guarded-movement.md). It offers at most one ordinary
half-forward input sample, clears its owned fields at tick end, and waits for
release before acknowledging. Its 100 ms bound is a handler-entry-to-sample lease,
not held-key duration or a physical stopping guarantee. It does not brake vanilla
momentum, and stalled cleanup can block acknowledgement. Navigation-only turning
and a real external movement adapter remain absent.

The complete movement build passed 35 JUnit cases, including 21 movement tests.
No installation or live input was performed for this extension. See
[movement build verification](docs/movement-verification.md).
